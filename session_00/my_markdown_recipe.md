## Ingredients

- 200g unsalted butter, softened
- 200g granulated sugar
- 4 large eggs
- 200g self-raising flour
- Zest of 2 lemons
- Juice of 1 lemon
- 100g granulated sugar (for the drizzle)

## Instructions

1. Preheat your oven to 180°C (350°F) and grease a 9-inch round cake tin.

2. In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy.

3. Beat in the eggs, one at a time, ensuring each egg is fully incorporated before adding the next.

4. Sift the self-raising flour into the bowl and gently fold it into the mixture until well combined.

5. Add the lemon zest and juice to the batter, giving it a good stir to distribute the flavors evenly.

6. Pour the batter into the prepared cake tin and smooth the top with a spatula.

7. Bake in the preheated oven for approximately 35-40 minutes or until a skewer inserted into the center comes out clean.

8. While the cake is baking, prepare the lemon drizzle. In a small bowl, mix the granulated sugar and lemon juice until the sugar has dissolved.

9. Once the cake is baked, remove it from the oven and leave it to cool in the tin for a few minutes.

10. While the cake is still warm, use a skewer or toothpick to poke several holes all over the top. This will allow the lemon drizzle to soak into the cake.

11. Pour the lemon drizzle over the warm cake, ensuring it is evenly distributed.

12. Allow the cake to cool completely in the tin before removing it.

13. Once the cake has cooled, transfer it to a serving plate and slice it into generous portions.

14. Serve and enjoy!

**Tip:** For an extra lemony touch, you can also make a simple lemon glaze by mixing icing sugar with lemon juice until you achieve a smooth, pourable consistency. Drizzle the glaze over the cooled cake for an added burst of flavor.

Now you have a delicious lemon drizzle cake to share with your friends and family. Enjoy!
